# Basic User Sign Up Contact Form with password encryption

### Tech Stack
* React Frontend with Bootstrap 4 Form 
* Express Backend, serving a REST-API 
* bcrypt for password encryption (https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js/blob/master/README.md) 

This demo only shows a basic post request with user sign up information and then the
process of hashing the user's pw with bcrypt-hashing-algorithm. 

The hashed pw you would then store in your database and de-crypt if user wants to sign in.
